With the help of this application, users can search for concerts, songs or movies on the command line. This node application utilizes Bands In Town, Spotify and OMDB API calls and modules to make request from CLI.
<br>
Here are the detail infornations on what each command will do:
<br>
1. node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here><br>

The project was possible with the help of several dependencies including:

Axios -  to make HTTP requests <br>
Moment - to format times (MM/DD/YYYY) <br>
.env - to hide API keys <br>
Node-Spotify-API - for song information <br>
OMDB API -  for movie information <br>
Bands In Town API - for show information. <br>

As a developer, I take help of these dependencies and node.js application to make this project possible.
